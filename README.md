## Technologies
I specilize in Microsoft based languages and frameworks such as **C#, ASP.NET, .NET Core**. However these skills were used only for my career progression. In order to explore other opensource technologies I used the freelance projects as a stepping-stone.

During the course of these projects I learned, used and implemented the below technologies


Framework| RunTime| Library| Languages
